Setup files for idealized internal tidal bore ROMS simulations in Dauhajre et al. 2021 (JPO)

The following two scripts are called to generate netcdf files to be used with ROMS

generate_set_variable_N2.py --> creates grid, initial condition, and boundary condition for 
                                variable stratification cases (pink/purple lines in Fig. 2 of Dauhajre et al. 2021)

generate_set_uniform_N2.py --> creates grid, initial condition, and boundary condition for 
                                uniform stratification cases (yellow/green/blue lines in Fig. 2 of Dauhajre et al. 2021)


To create fixed U_0 / c cases, turn on U0_c_fixed boolean switch in params.py
